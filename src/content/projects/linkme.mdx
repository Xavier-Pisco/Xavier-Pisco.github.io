Website for a social media that is close to a mixture between Facebook and Twitter, which used PostgreSQL as the server database.

Development focused on methodologies such as: user stories, requirements, wireframes, etc.

Worked on a Restful API that connects the Laravel backend to the HTML, CSS and Javascript frontend.
