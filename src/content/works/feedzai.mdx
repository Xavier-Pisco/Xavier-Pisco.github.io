Automate the explanation of data science variable names to be used by the analysts which was previously done manually.

Worked on the complete development of the feature: talked with clients, worked with the UX team in Figma, implemented the code in React, Backbone.js, and Sass, and tested the feature with Jest, cypress and Selenium.
